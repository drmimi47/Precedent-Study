    <h2>What is <a href="https://haquetan.com/growing-riversiders/" target="_blank">HAQUE TAN</a></h2>
    <p>Established in 2024, HAQUE TAN is a multidisciplinary design studio operating out of London, Marseille, and Singapore. It is led by architects Ling Tan and Usman Haque—both acclaimed for their work across design and the arts. Drawing from their extensive backgrounds in architecture, interactive media, software development, and community-driven initiatives, they also co-founded the urban technology practice Umbrellium.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>HAQUE, Usman</h2>
    <p>Usman Haque is an architect-trained designer known for his groundbreaking work in interactive architecture, urban technology, and participatory public art. As founder of Umbrellium and co-creator of Pachube—one of the earliest platforms for IoT data—his influence spans over three decades and crosses disciplines from infrastructure design to large-scale urban installations. His projects have been featured globally and cited in hundreds of publications. A Design Council Ambassador and advisor to the Mayor of London’s Data for London board, Usman also co-leads Starling, a company focused on pedestrian safety. His accolades include the Design Museum’s Design of the Year Award (2008), the World Technology Award (2009), and top honors from Japan Media Arts and the Asia Digital Art Awards. He regularly speaks on the future of cities, digital participation, and how technology can transform shared urban spaces.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>TAN, Ling</h2>
    <p>Ling Tan is an architect-trained designer and creative technologist whose work explores how technology can foster dialogue and collective action within the built environment. Known for blending design, data science, and social engagement, she collaborates with communities around the world to address urban challenges like air quality, safety, and equity through participatory projects such as Low Carbon Chinatown and the SUPERPOWER! Toolkit. Her recent work includes developing an AI-driven system focused on sustainable food consumption and cultural identity. A recipient of awards including the STRP Act Award (2024) and Seoul Design Finalist (2023), Ling has also served as Associate Artistic Director at Kakilang and is currently a Design Council Expert. She frequently speaks on the intersections of diversity, urban technology, and citizen empowerment.</p>
