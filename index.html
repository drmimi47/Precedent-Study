    <p>Established in 2024, HAQUE TAN is a multidisciplinary design studio operating out of London, Marseille, and Singapore. It is led by architects Ling Tan and Usman Haque‚Äîboth acclaimed for their work across design and the arts. Drawing from their extensive backgrounds in architecture, interactive media, software development, and community-driven initiatives, they also co-founded the urban technology practice Umbrellium.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>HAQUE, Usman</h2>
    <p>Usman Haque is an architect-trained designer known for his groundbreaking work in interactive architecture, urban technology, and participatory public art. As founder of Umbrellium and co-creator of Pachube‚Äîone of the earliest platforms for IoT data‚Äîhis influence spans over three decades and crosses disciplines from infrastructure design to large-scale urban installations. His projects have been featured globally and cited in hundreds of publications. A Design Council Ambassador and advisor to the Mayor of London‚Äôs Data for London board, Usman also co-leads Starling, a company focused on pedestrian safety. His accolades include the Design Museum‚Äôs Design of the Year Award (2008), the World Technology Award (2009), and top honors from Japan Media Arts and the Asia Digital Art Awards. He regularly speaks on the future of cities, digital participation, and how technology can transform shared urban spaces.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>TAN, Ling</h2>
    <p>Ling Tan is an architect-trained designer and creative technologist whose work explores how technology can foster dialogue and collective action within the built environment. Known for blending design, data science, and social engagement, she collaborates with communities around the world to address urban challenges like air quality, safety, and equity through participatory projects such as Low Carbon Chinatown and the SUPERPOWER! Toolkit. Her recent work includes developing an AI-driven system focused on sustainable food consumption and cultural identity.

    <h1>An <a href="https://haquetan.com/growing-riversiders/" target="_blank"><u>URBAN GARDEN</u></a> Co-Created by 100 Families</h1>
    <p>During the isolation of London's 2021 lockdown, Growing Riversiders explored how remote communities could still come together to shape public space. Blending digital coordination with hands-on care, the project invited 100 families to each nurture four plants at home, plants that would later become individual "pixels" in a large-scale living image reflecting the community's shared identity. Rooted in the everyday act of caregiving, the project culminated in a collective installation of over 400 plants at the Wilds Ecology Centre, where families assembled the landscape in staggered time slots, transforming personal efforts into a public, collaborative intervention.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Digital platform and Mobile Web App</h2>
    <p>To support the community's involvement, a custom digital platform was developed to help participants grow, track, and share their plants' progress from home. The platform also allowed families to experiment with possible layouts for the final installation, which would eventually take the form of a honey bee‚Äîa powerful symbol of collaboration and sustainability. This living artwork became a celebration of local environmental values and collective care. Remarkably, every single plant was returned to the site for the final assembly, reflecting a strong sense of shared responsibility and a successful vision of co-creation at Barking Riverside.</p>
