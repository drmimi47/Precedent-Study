    <br>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Growing Riversiders is a collaborative project that merges art, ecology, and technology in Barking Riverside, London. Launched during the COVID-19 pandemic, the project brought together one hundred local families who each grew a plant, forming a "living pixel" in a large-scale honey bee mosaic. This initiative blends digital inspiration with tangible, collective action among community members.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This chapter explores the key elements that make up the project (its ontology), situates it within its social and historical context, and looks closely at the ways it communicates through visual and aesthetic choices. By studying these layers, we can appreciate not just what the project is, but how and why it came to be, who it serves, and the meanings it creates for its community.</p>

    <p>An interactive grid of 20x20 pixel squares provides a digital reflection of the garden's 20x20 arrangement of potted plants. Each square represents the concept of the physical project: every participant‚Äôs plant became a unique "pixel" in the final image, and each clickable square now stands as a virtual point of engagement. This digital grid allows users to experience the project‚Äôs values of individual contribution, collective composition, and ongoing transformation in a virtual setting; reafirming the relationship between digital design and community-built ecological art.</p>

  <h1>Historical and Contextual Analysis</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Why Was This Made?</h2>
  <ul class="indented-bullets">
    <li>Addressed social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic by enabling creative collaboration while maintaining physical distance.</li>
    <li>Supported the formation of community ties in a newly built urban neighborhood where residents were seeking a sense of belonging.</li>
    <li>Challenged the limits of digital-only social connection by translating pixels from screens into real, ecological components.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h2>Authors Motivation</h2>
  <ul class="indented-bullets">
    <li>The author was motivated to reimagine digital participation as a shared, in-person ecological experience that nurtures genuine bonds among neighbors through collaborative creation, while emphasizing the visible and sustained impact of collective care.</li>
  </ul>
    <br>
  <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
  <ul class="indented-bullets">
    <li>Families and residents of Barking Riverside.</li>
    <li>Broader public through the community exhibition.</li>
    <li>Anyone interested in new connections between digital culture and community ecology.</li>
</section>

<section class="section-info">
  <h1>Visual and Aesthetic Analysis</h1>
  <br>
  
  <h2>Visual Language and Style</h2>
  <ul class="indented-bullets">
    <li>The primary image presents a pixelated mosaic of a honey bee, symbolizing ecological interdependence. Each "pixel" is composed of a potted plant, individually grown by neighborhood residents and later assembled to form a collective artwork that is both botanical and symbolic.</li>
    
    <li>The pixel-art aesthetic draws on the visual language of early digital imagery, but it is materially reimagined through the use of living vegetation. This translation from screen-based pixels to soil-based modules challenges traditional boundaries between technology and nature.</li>
    
    <li>The piece transforms over time as the plants naturally grow and shift in color and form, making the artwork a living, evolving display that reflects broader themes of environmental resilience and community collaboration.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  
  <h2>Connection to Interactive Grid</h2>
  <ul class="indented-bullets">
    <li>The underlying 20x20 digital grid not only organizes the placement of each plant but also serves as a conceptual framework, bridging the binary clarity of digital systems with the organic unpredictability of ecological growth.</li>
    
    <li>This interactive matrix becomes a metaphor for collective participation, where individual contributions‚Äîwhether planting a pot or clicking a pixel‚Äîare essential to forming a cohesive whole, reinforcing themes of interactivity, cooperation, and shared authorship.</li>
  </ul>
